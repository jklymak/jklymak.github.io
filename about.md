This is the software list page for the [Uvic Ocean Physics Group](http://web.uvic.ca/~jklymak). This is meant to help students who are in the group and to help the group have a cohesive set of analysis procedures.  

# How did this page get made?

See [http://jklymak.github.io/projtemplate](http://jklymak.github.io/projtemplate) for the steps for setting up a page like [http://jklymak.github.io/projectname](http://jklymak.github.io/projectname).  For this page, its the same steps, but the source is the master of [https://github.com/jklymak/jklymak.github.io](https://github.com/jklymak/jklymak.github.io)

## Where do I keep it locally?
